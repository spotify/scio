# Versions

Starting from version 0.3.0, Scio moved from Google Cloud [Dataflow Java SDK](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK) to [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) as its core dependencies and introduced a few breaking changes.

- Dataflow Java SDK 1.x.x uses `com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk` namespace.
- Apache Beam uses `org.apache.beam.sdk` namespace.
- Dataflow Java SDK 2.x.x is also based on Apache Beam 2.x.x and uses `org.apache.beam.sdk`.

Scio 0.3.x depends on Beam 0.6.0 (last pre-stable release) and Scio 0.4.x depends on Beam 2.0.0 (first stable release). Breaking changes in these releases are documented below.

## Version matrices

Early Scio releases depend on Google Cloud [Dataflow Java SDK](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK) while later ones depend on [Apache Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam). Check out the [[Changelog]] page for migration guides.

## Release cycle and backport procedures

Scio has a frequent release cycle, roughly every 2-4 weeks, as compared to months for the upstream Apache Beam. We also aim to stay a step ahead by pulling changes from upstream and contributing new ones back.

Let's call the Beam version that Scio depends on `current`, and upstream master `latest`. Here're the procedures for backporting changes.

For changes available in `latest` but not in `current`:
- Copy Java files from `latest` to Scio repo
- Rename classes and modify as necessary
- Release Scio
- Update checklist for the next `current` version like @github[#633](#633)
- Remove change once `current` is updated

For changes we want to make to `latest`:
- Submit pull request to `latest`
- Follow the steps above once merged

## Beam master nightly build

To keep up with upstream changes, [beam-master](https://github.com/spotify/scio/tree/beam-master) branch is built nightly and depends on latest Beam SNAPSHOT.

We should do the following periodically to reduce work when upgrading Beam release version.
- rebase `beam-master` on `master`
- fix for breaking changes in `beam-master`
- rebase `master` on `beam-master` when upgrading Beam release version.

To work on a breaking change:
- checkout `beam-master` branch
- run `./scripts/circleci_snapshot.sh` to change `beamVersion` to the latest SNAPSHOT
- run `sbt test it:test` and fix errors
