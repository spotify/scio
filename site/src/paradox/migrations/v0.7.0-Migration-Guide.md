# Scio 0.7.0

Scio `0.7.0` comes with major improvements over previous versions. The overall goal is to make Scio safer, faster, more consistent and easier to extend by leveraging Scala's type system more and refactoring its internals.

The new milestone has been profiled more than ever and will improve the performances of your pipeline. In some cases, the improvement can be *very* significant.

Scio `0.7.0` also includes, like every release, a number of bugfixes.

## What's new ?

### New IOs api

In this version, we've refactored the implementation of IOs.
Scio now provides a new class `ScioIO` that you can extend to support new types of IOs.
`ScioContext` now has a new method called `read` and `SCollection` now has a new method `write`. Both take an instance of a class extending `ScioIO` as a parameter and may read from any source, or write to any target.

All existing IOs (GCS, BigQuery, BigTable, etc.) have been rewritten to use the new IO API.

**Read more: @ref:[ScioIO](../internals/ScioIO.md)**

### New "static" coders

Scio `0.7.0` also ship with a new `Coder` implementation that statically resolve the correct `Coder` for a given type **at compile time**. In previous versions, Scio would infer the correct coder implementation at runtime, which could lead to poor performances and occasionally, exceptions at runtime.

**Read more: @ref:[Coders](../internals/Coders.md).**

### Performances improvements & benchmarks

Thanks to the new static coders implementation, and because of the time we spend on profiling, Scio `0.7.0` should overall be more efficient than previous versions.

## Automated migration

Scio `0.7` comes with a set of [scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/) rules that will do most of the heavy lifting automatically.
Before you go through any manual step, we recommend you start by applying those rules.

Start by adding the scalafix sbt plugin to your `project/plugins.sbt` file

```scala
addSbtPlugin("ch.epfl.scala" % "sbt-scalafix" % "0.9.0")
```

launch sbt and run `scalafixEnable`

```
> scalafixEnable
[info] Set current project to my-amazing-scio-pipeline (in build file:/Users/julient/Documents/my-amazing-scio-pipeline/)
```

### Prepare your tests

@@@ warning
RUN THIS BEFORE UPGRADING SCIO
@@@

You'll need to prepare your tests code for migration.
For this to run properly, you code needs to compile.

Run the following command in the sbt shell:

```
> test:scalafix github:spotify/scio/FixAvroIO
[info] Running scalafix on 78 Scala sources
[success] Total time: 7 s, completed Oct 17, 2018 12:49:31 PM
```

Once `FixAvroIO` has been applied, you can go ahead and upgrade Scio to `0.7.x` in your build file.
After you have set Scio's version in your `build.sbt`, make sure to either restart or reload sbt.

You can now run the automated migration rules.
At the moment, we support 4 rules:

|        Name         |                                      Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AddMissingImports   | Add the required imports to access sources / sinks on `ScioContext` and `SCollection` |
| RewriteSysProp      | Replace `sys.call(...)` by the new syntax                                             |
| FixAvroIO           | Fix uses of `AvroIO` in tests                                                         |
| BQClientRefactoring | Automatically migrate from `BigQueryClient` to the new `BigQuery` client              |


You can see all the rules @github[here](/scalafix/rules/src/main/scala/fix).

In your sbt shell, you can now apply the 3 other rules:

```
> scalafix github:spotify/scio/AddMissingImports
[info] Running scalafix on 173 Scala sources
[success] Total time: 16 s, completed Oct 17, 2018 12:01:31 PM

[info] Running scalafix on 173 Scala sources
[success] Total time: 3 s, completed Oct 17, 2018 12:34:20 PM
```

At that point you can try to compile your code and fix the few compilation errors left.
The next sections of this guide should contain all the information you need to fix everything.

## Migration guide

The following section will detail errors you may encounter while migrating from scio `0.6.x` to Scio `0.7.x`, and help you fix them.  If you've run the automated migration fixes, you can jump directly to the **Add missing context bounds** section.

### `method xxx is not a member of com.spotify.scio.ScioContext`

When using read methods from `ScioContext` the compiler may issue an error of type `method xxx is not a member of com.spotify.scio.ScioContext`.

IOs have been refactored in Scio `0.7.0`. Each IO type now lives in the appropriate project and package. It means 2 things:

#### You may need to explicitly add a dependency one of Scio's subprojects in your build file

For example, Scio used to pull dependencies on BigQuery IOs even if your pipeline did not use BigQuery at all. With the new IOs, Scio will limit its dependencies to packages you actually use.

If your pipeline is using BigQuery, you now need to add `scio-bigquery` as a dependency of your project:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.spotify" %% "scio-bigquery" % scioVersion
```

#### You'll need to import the appropriate package to gain access to the IO methods.

For example while migrating a job that reads data from an Avro file, you may see the following compiler error:

```
[error] value avroFile is not a member of com.spotify.scio.ScioContext
[error]     val coll = sc.avroFile[SomeType](uri)
[error]                            ^
```

All you have to do to fix it is to import IOs from the correct package:

```scala mdoc:silent
import com.spotify.scio.avro._
```

### `AvroIO` (or other type of IO) `not found`

IOs have been moved out of the `com.spotify.scio.testing` package. To use them in unit tests (or elsewhere), you'll need to change the import:

- `com.spotify.scio.testing.BigQueryIO` -> `com.spotify.scio.bigquery.BigQueryIO`
- `com.spotify.scio.testing.{AvroIO, ProtobufIO}` -> `com.spotify.scio.avro.{AvroIO, ProtobufIO}`
- `com.spotify.scio.testing.TextIO` -> `com.spotify.scio.io.TextIO`

A complete list of IO packages can be found [here](https://spotify.github.com/scio/internals/ScioIO).

Additionally, some IOs are now parameterized. For example, `AvroIO` must now be parameterized with the Avro record type (either `GenericRecord` or an extension of `SpecificRecordBase`). In previous versions of Scio, it was possible in some cases to omit that type. For example:

```scala mdoc:invisible
import org.apache.avro.generic.GenericRecord

object MyScioJob {}

val inputAUri = ""
val inputBUri = ""
val output = "output"

object Schemas {
  def record1: GenericRecord = ???
  def record2: GenericRecord = ???
}

implicit def bo: com.spotify.scio.testing.JobTest.BeamOptions = ??? // XXX: why do I need this ?
```

```scala mdoc:silent
import com.spotify.scio.io._
import com.spotify.scio.avro._
import com.spotify.scio.testing._

class MyScioJobTest extends PipelineSpec {

  "MyScioJob" should "work" in {
    JobTest[MyScioJob.type]
      .args(s"--inputAUri=${inputAUri}")
      .args(s"--inputBUri=${inputBUri}")
      .input(AvroIO[GenericRecord](inputAUri), Seq(Schemas.record1))
      .input(AvroIO[GenericRecord](inputBUri), Seq(Schemas.record2))
      .output(TextIO(output)){ coll =>
        coll should haveSize (1)
        ()
      }
      .run()
  }

  // more tests
}
```

#### Avro type inference issue: "diverging implicit expansion"

If you use `AvroIO` you may see the compilation of your tests failing with an error looking like

```
[error] <path>/SomeTest.scala:42:20: diverging implicit expansion for type com.spotify.scio.coders.Coder[K]
[error] starting with macro method gen in trait LowPriorityCoderDerivation
[error]       .input(AvroIO(inputUri), inputs)
[error]
```

The problem is that line does not explicitly set the type of the IO:

```scala
.input(AvroIO(inputUri), inputs)
```

In Scio <= `0.6.x` this works, but in Scio `0.7.x`, you'll need to be explicit about the types. For example in that case:

```scala
.input(AvroIO[GenericRecord](inputUri), inputs)
```

### Not enough arguments for method (top|topByKey|approxQuantilesByKey): (implicit ord: Ordering[...])

Explicit `Ordering` functions for `SCollection` reducers are no longer curried. Methods that used to look like:

```scala
.top(10)(Ordering.by(...)
```

should be changed to:

```scala
.top(10, Ordering.by(...))
```

### Add missing context bounds

In the process of upgrading Scio, you may encounter the following error:

> Cannot find a Coder instance for type T

If you've defined a generic function that uses a `SCollection`, this function is likely to need a `Coder[T]`. Scio will require you to provide an implicit `Coder[T]`. You can read about Scala implicit parameters [here](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/implicit-parameters.html)

Let's see a simple example. Say I created the following method `doSomething`:

```scala
def doSomething[T](coll: SCollection[T]): SCollection[T] =
  coll.map { t =>
    // do something that returns a T
    val result: T = ???
    result
  }
```

If I try to compile this method the compiler will return the following error:

```
Cannot find a Coder instance for type:

  >> T

  This can happen for a few reasons, but the most common case is that a data
  member somewhere within this type doesn't have a Coder instance in scope. Here are
  some debugging hints:
    - For Option types, ensure that a Coder instance is in scope for the non-Option version.
    - For List and Seq types, ensure that a Coder instance is in scope for a single element.
    - You can check that an instance exists for Coder in the REPL or in your code:
        scala> Coder[Foo]
    And find the missing instance and construct it as needed.

  coll.map { t =>
           ^
```

What this message says is that calling `.map { ... }` requires a `Coder[T]`.
You can fix this very easily by adding a new implicit parameter to your method:

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
import com.spotify.scio.coders.Coder
import com.spotify.scio.values.SCollection

def doSomething[T](coll: SCollection[T])(implicit coder: Coder[T]): SCollection[T] =
  coll.map { t =>
    // do something that returns a T
    val result: T = ???
    result
  }
```

Alternatively, the same result can be achieved using Scala's context bound syntax:

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
import com.spotify.scio.coders.Coder
import com.spotify.scio.values.SCollection

def doSomething[T: Coder](coll: SCollection[T]): SCollection[T] =
  coll.map { t =>
    // do something that returns a T
    val result: T = ???
    result
  }
```

### Replacing Kryo fallbacks with your own coders.


Most of the time, the compiler will be able to find or derive an appropriate Coder automatically. Sometimes, it may not be able to find one automatically. This will typically happen for:

- Classes defined in Java
- Scala classes that are not case classes
- Classes with a private constructor

In those cases, Scio will fallback to using [Kryo](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo).

#### Showing all fallback at compile time

The compiler can show a message each time a fallback is used. To activate that feature, just the the following scalac option: `-Xmacro-settings:show-coder-fallback=true`.

You can fix this warning in two ways:

- Implement a proper `Coder` for this type
- Make it explicit that the `Kryo` coder is in fact the one you want to use.

In both cases you want to define a Coder in your own code. The only difference is how you'll implement it.

Let's say you are using a `SCollection[java.util.Locale]`:

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
import com.spotify.scio.values.SCollection

def doSomething(coll: SCollection[String]): SCollection[java.util.Locale] =
  coll.map { t =>
    // do something that returns a Locale
    val result: java.util.Locale = ???
    result
  }
```

#### Using Kryo explicitly

If you want to explicitly use `Kryo` (which will probably be the case) you can do the following:

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
import java.util.Locale
import com.spotify.scio.coders.Coder

object Coders {
  implicit val coderLocale: Coder[Locale] = Coder.kryo[Locale]
}
```

Now all you have to do is make that available at call site:

```scala mdoc:silent
import com.spotify.scio.values.SCollection
import Coders._

def doSomething(coll: SCollection[String]): SCollection[java.util.Locale] =
  coll.map { t =>
    // do something that returns a Locale
    val result: java.util.Locale = ???
    result
  }
```

#### Defining a custom `Coder`

If you want to implement custom coders, see Scio's source code for @github[examples](/scio-core/src/main/scala/com/spotify/scio/coders/instances).

@@@ warning
Before implementing custom coders, we recommend that you test your pipeline with the default coders. Implementing custom coders can be tricky, so make sure there's a clear benefit in doing it. If you implement custom Coders, you need to make sure they are  Serializable.

### WartRemover compatibility.

Automatically derived coders are generated by a macro. Unfortunately, if you use [WartRemover](https://www.wartremover.org/) in your project, the macro will trigger warnings.
There's not much we can do in the macro to fix the issue right now, so you'll have to disable a few warts. Here are the warts you'll need to disable in your project:

```scala
- Any
- IsInstanceOf
- Throw
```

If you use `sbt-wartremover`, you can disable them in your build like this:

```scala
wartremoverErrors in (Compile, compile) := {
  val disableWarts = Set(
    Wart.Any,
    Wart.IsInstanceOf,
    Wart.Throw
  )
  Warts.unsafe.filterNot(disableWarts.contains)
},

wartremoverErrors in (Test, compile) := {
  val disableWarts = Set(
    Wart.Any,
    Wart.IsInstanceOf,
    Wart.Throw
  )
  Warts.unsafe.filterNot(disableWarts.contains)
}
```
