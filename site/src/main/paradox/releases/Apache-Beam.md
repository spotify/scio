# Apache Beam Compatibility

Starting from version 0.3.0, Scio moved from Google Cloud [Dataflow Java SDK](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK) to [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) as its core dependencies and introduced a few breaking changes.

- Dataflow Java SDK 1.x.x uses `com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk` namespace.
- Apache Beam uses `org.apache.beam.sdk` namespace.
- Dataflow Java SDK 2.x.x is also based on Apache Beam 2.x.x and uses `org.apache.beam.sdk`.

Scio 0.3.x depends on Beam 0.6.0 (last pre-stable release) and Scio 0.4.x depends on Beam 2.0.0 (first stable release). Breaking changes in these releases are documented below.

## Version matrices

Early Scio releases depend on Google Cloud [Dataflow Java SDK](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK) while later ones depend on [Apache Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam). Check out the [[Changelog]] page for migration guides.

Also check out the [SDK Version Support Status](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/support/sdk-version-support-status) page. Since a Beam release depends on specific version of Dataflow API, a deprecated Beam version is not guaranteed to work correctly or at all. We strongly recommend upgrading before the deprecation date.

## Beam dependencies

Scio's other library dependencies are kept in sync with Beam's to avoid compatibility issues. Scio will typically _not_ bump dependency versions beyond what is supported in Beam due to the large test surface and the potential for data loss.

You can find Beam's dependency list in its [Groovy config](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/v2.35.0/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/org/apache/beam/gradle/BeamModulePlugin.groovy) (substitute the version tag in the URL with the desired Beam version). Additionally, Beam keeps many of its Google dependencies in sync with a [central BOM](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-opensource-java-dashboard/com.google.cloud/libraries-bom/24.0.0/artifact_details.html) (substitute the version tag in the URL with the value of `google_cloud_platform_libraries_bom` from Beam). Scio users who suspect incompatibility issues in their pipelines (common issues are GRPC, Netty, or Guava) can run `sbt evicted` and `sbt dependencyTree` to ensure their direct and transitive dependencies don't conflict with Scio or Beam.

## Release cycle and backport procedures

Scio has a frequent release cycle, roughly every 2-4 weeks, as compared to months for the upstream Apache Beam. We also aim to stay a step ahead by pulling changes from upstream and contributing new ones back.

Let's call the Beam version that Scio depends on `current`, and upstream master `latest`. Here are the procedures for backporting changes:

For changes available in `latest` but not in `current`:
- Copy Java files from `latest` to Scio repo
- Rename classes and modify as necessary
- Release Scio
- Update checklist for the next `current` version like @github[#633](#633)
- Remove change once `current` is updated

For changes we want to make to `latest`:
- Submit pull request to `latest`
- Follow the steps above once merged
