# Scio v0.12.0

## `com.spotify.scio.extra.bigquery` removal

For usages of `saveAvroAsBigQuery`, use `saveAsBigQueryTable` from `com.spotify.scio.bigquery` instead.

```diff
- scoll.saveAvroAsBigQuery(tableRef)
+ scoll.saveAsBigQueryTable(table)
```

Note: you can run the following sbt command to run the relevant [scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/docs/developers/tutorial.html#run-the-rule-from-source-code) rules to update your BQ API usages:

```
sbt "scalafixEnable; scalafix https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spotify/scio/main/scalafix/rules/src/main/scala/fix/v0_12_0/FixBqSaveAsTable.scala"
```

## Removal of `com.spotify.scio.pubsub` specializations

Specialized methods in `com.spotify.scio.pubsub` have been removed in favor of generic `.read` and `.write` methods.

The `PubsubIO.apply` method has been completely removed, use `PubsubIO.string`, `PubsubIO.avro`, `PubsubIO.proto`, `PubsubIO.pubsub` or `PubsubIO.coder` instead.

Additionally:

* `PubsubIO.readString` is replaced by `PubsubIO.string`
* `PubsubIO.readAvro` is replaced by `PubsubIO.avro`
* `PubsubIO.readProto` is replaced by `PubsubIO.proto`
* `PubsubIO.readPubsub` is replaced by `PubsubIO.pubsub`
* `PubsubIO.readCoder` is replaced by `PubsubIO.coder`

The `pubsubSubscription` and `pubsubTopic` methods are replaced by one of the preceding IOs in conjunction with a `PubsubIO.ReadParam`. For example:
```scala
sc.read(PubsubIO.string(subscription, idAttribute, timestampAttribute))(PubsubIO.ReadParam(PubsubIO.Subscription))
sc.read(PubsubIO.string(topic, idAttribute, timestampAttribute))(PubsubIO.ReadParam(PubsubIO.Topic))
```

The `pubsubSubscriptionWithAttributes` and `pubsubTopicWithAttributes` methods are replaced by `PubsubIO.withAttributes`. For example:
```scala
sc.read(PubsubIO.withAttributes[String](subscription, idAttribute, timestampAttribute))(PubsubIO.ReadParam(PubsubIO.Subscription))
sc.read(PubsubIO.withAttributes[String](topic, idAttribute, timestampAttribute))(PubsubIO.ReadParam(PubsubIO.Topic))
```

The `saveAsPubsub` and `saveAsPubsubWithAttributes` are similarly replaced in conjunction with a `PubsubIO.WriteParam`:
```scala
scoll.write(PubsubIO.string(topic, idAttribute, timestampAttribute))(PubsubIO.WriteParam())
scoll.write(PubsubIO.withAttributes[String](topic, idAttribute, timestampAttribute))(PubsubIO.WriteParam())
```

Note: you can run the following sbt command to run the relevant [scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/docs/developers/tutorial.html#run-the-rule-from-source-code) rules to automatically update deprecated Pub/Sub API usages:

```
sbt "scalafixEnable; scalafix https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spotify/scio/main/scalafix/rules/src/main/scala/fix/v0_12_0/FixPubsubSpecializations.scala"
```

## Changed type signatures of SMB methods

There are substantial changes to the java SMB API to accommodate secondary-keyed SMB. 
For example, `AvroSortedBucketIO.Write` changes signature from `Write<K, T extends GenericRecord>` to `Write<K1, K2, T extends GenericRecord>`. Most users will only interact with the scala API.

## Removed Beam-SQL

Removed `typedBigQueryTable` methods. Use instead `bigQuerySelect`, `bigQueryTable`, `bigQueryStorage`, `typedBigQuery`, or `typedBigQueryStorage`.

## File IO file naming

File-based IO methods now have a consistent file-naming interface.
`saveAs*` methods now accept, in addition to `path` and `suffix`, an optional `shardNameTemplate`, `tempDirectory`, and `filenamePolicySupplier`.
`shardNameTemplate` and `filenamePolicySupplier` are mutually exclusive.

`shardNameTemplate` is a string pattern for filenames as accepted by [`DefaultFilenamePolicy.constructName`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/DefaultFilenamePolicy.java#L255).

`filenamePolicySupplier` is an instance of `FilenamePolicySupplier`, which takes the `path` and `suffix` as provided to most `saveAs*` methods and returns a `FilenamePolicy`.

## BinaryIO saveAsBinaryFile

`saveAsBinaryFile` has been updated to use `FilenamePolicySupplier` per above and drops support for `FileNaming`.

## ParquetIO saveAsDynamicParquetAvroFile → saveAsParquetAvroFile

`saveAsDynamicParquetAvroFile` had an inconsistent interface compared to other `saveAsDynamic*` methods.

The pre-0.12 behavior of the `filenameFunction` parameter of `saveAsDynamicParquetAvroFile` is now supported via the `FilenamePolicySupplier` parameter of the non-dynamic `saveAsParquetAvroFile`, per above.

A new and more consistent `saveAsDynamicParquetAvroFile` is added:

```scala
import com.spotify.scio.values.SCollection
import com.spotify.scio.parquet.avro.dynamic._
case class MyClass(s: String, i: Int)
val scoll: SCollection[MyClass] = ???
scoll.saveAsDynamicParquetAvroFile("gs://output/") { m => s"/${m.s}/${m.i}"}
```

## Parquet Reads

Alongside the existing Parquet read implementation ("legacy Parquet"), we're concurrently offering a new Parquet read implementation that uses Beam's new [SplittableDoFn](https://beam.apache.org/blog/splittable-do-fn/)
API. Legacy Parquet is still the default read format, but can enable the new implementation in your `Configuration`:

```scala
import com.spotify.scio.parquet._

sc.typedParquetFile[T](path, conf = ParquetConfiguration.of("scio.parquet.read.useSplittableDoFn" -> true))
sc.parquetAvroFile[T](path, conf = ParquetConfiguration.of("scio.parquet.read.useSplittableDoFn" -> true))
sc.parquetExampleFile(path, conf = ParquetConfiguration.of("scio.parquet.read.useSplittableDoFn" -> true))
```

Additionally, you can enable it for all Scio jobs in your project by adding it to your project's `src/main/resources/core-site.xml` file:

```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>scio.parquet.read.useSplittableDoFn</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>Use SplittableDoFn implementation for Parquet reads</description>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

Note that if you're using DataflowRunner, you'll get the best performance (in terms of worker scaling and overall resource usage)
out of a SplittableDoFn-based read by enabling [Dataflow Runner V2](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/deploying-a-pipeline#dataflow-runner-v2).
You can enable this in your Dataflow pipeline by supplying the pipeline argument `--experiments=use_runner_v2` to your job.

Our plan is to support Legacy Parquet for all Scio 0.12.x versions, but fully deprecate and remove support by 0.13.x.

## Async lookup DoFn

All Async lookup DoFn have been reworked and now extends `DoFnWithResource`.
After upgrade, you'll get the following error:

```
class MyLookupDoFn needs to be abstract, since method getResourceType in class DoFnWithResource of type ()com.spotify.scio.transforms.DoFnWithResource.ResourceType is not defined
```

You must now implement the method and return the appropriate resource type for your client:
- `ResourceType.PER_INSTANCE` if your client is thread safe (this was the previous behavior)
- `ResourceType.PER_CLONE` if your client is not thread safe
- `ResourceType.PER_CLASS` if your client is meant to be shared among all instances
