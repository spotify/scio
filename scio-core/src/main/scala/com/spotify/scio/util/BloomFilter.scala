/*
 * An implementation of a mutable bloom filter Algebird monoid and aggregator.
 *
 * This is incompatible with Algebird's implementation of BloomFilter, and cannot be converted
 * to Algebird bloom filter because it uses a different implementation of hashing underneath.
 *
 * Upstream PR in Algebird / BloomFilter Benchmark results:
 * https://github.com/twitter/algebird/pull/673/
 *
 * Why do we use mutable BloomFilter:
 * A BloomFilter is modelled as a BoundedSemilattice which means they are commutative semigroups
 * (i.e. combine) whose operation are also idempotent. In Scio the best known usage is where we
 * create bloom filters from a SCollection to filter elements before a join for cases where elements
 * of one SCollection is Sparse in the other. Idempotency of the data structure means that if there
 * are failures in intermediate steps while creating a BloomFilterMonoid, and they are retried, they
 * won't result in an invalid BloomFilter. We also never need to access a BloomFilter which has
 * a limited number of elements from an SCollection. This Bloom Filter should only be used to go
 * from SCollection[T] => SCollection[BFMonoid[T]/] with only one BloomFilter.
