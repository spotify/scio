Scio is a Scala API for [Apache Beam](http://beam.incubator.apache.org/) and [Google Cloud Dataflow](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK) inspired by [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding).

Scio 0.3.0 and future versions depend on Apache Beam (`org.apache.beam`) while earlier versions depend on Google Cloud Dataflow SDK (`com.google.cloud.dataflow`). See this [page](https://github.com/spotify/scio/wiki/Apache-Beam) for a list of breaking changes.

# Features

- Scala API close to that of Spark and Scalding core APIs
- Unified batch and streaming programming model
- Fully managed service<sup>*</sup>
- Integration with Google Cloud products: Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Datastore, Bigtable
- HDFS, JDBC, [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/) TFRecords, Cassandra, Elasticsearch and Parquet I/O
- Interactive mode with Scio REPL
- Type safe BigQuery
- Integration with [Algebird](https://github.com/twitter/algebird) and [Breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze)
- Pipeline orchestration with [Scala Futures](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html)
- Distributed cache

# Quick Start

Use our [giter8 template](https://github.com/spotify/scio.g8) to quickly setup a project:

`sbt new spotify/scio.g8`

Compile it:

`sbt pack`

Run the included word count example:

`target/pack/bin/word-count --output=wc`

Inspect the results:

`cat wc/part-00000-of-00001.txt`

# Documentation

[Getting Started](https://github.com/spotify/scio/wiki/Getting-Started) is the best place to start with Scio. If you are new to Apache Beam and distributed data processing, check out the [Beam Programming Guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/) first for a detailed explanation of the Beam programming model and concepts. If you have experience with other Scala data processing libraries, check out this comparison between [Scio, Scalding and Spark](https://github.com/spotify/scio/wiki/Scio%2C-Scalding-and-Spark). Finally check out this document about the relationship between [Scio, Beam and Dataflow](https://github.com/spotify/scio/wiki/Scio,-Beam-and-Dataflow).

Example Scio pipelines and tests can be found under [scio-examples](https://github.com/spotify/scio/tree/master/scio-examples/src). A lot of them are direct ports from Beam's Java [examples](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/examples). See this [page](http://spotify.github.io/scio/examples/) for some of them with side-by-side explanation. Also see [Big Data Rosetta Code](https://github.com/spotify/big-data-rosetta-code) for common data processing code snippets in Scio, Scalding and Spark.
