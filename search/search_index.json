If they are not, Scio will attempt to find an active Application Default Credential and set the billing project to the value from DefaultProjectFactory. As of Scio 0.11.6, you can set the SBT option bigquery.debug_auth=true, which enables Scio to log the active credential used in BigQuery queries that return a 403 FORBIDDEN status.\nA service account impersonation is available using SBT option bigquery.act_as=service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com. It requires roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator to be granted to a source account.\nNote that BigQuery Storage APIs don’t require an export job as they can read from BigQuery directly.","title":"BigQuery authentication"},{"location":"/io/BigQuery.html#bigquery-configurations-in-sbt","text":"Scio offers several BigQuery options that can be configured as SBT options - either in a root-level .sbtopts file or in your SBT process as sbt -D{$OPT_KEY}=${OPT_VALUE} ...:\nOption Description bigquery.project Specifies the billing project to use for queries.

They may also be used by beam to test instances for equality. Anytime you create an SCollection[T], Beam needs to know how to go from an instance of T to an array of bytes, and from that array of bytes to an instance of T.\nThe Beam SDK defines a class called Coder that roughly looks like this:\npublic abstract class Coder<T> implements Serializable {\n  public abstract void encode(T value, OutputStream outStream);\n  public abstract T decode(InputStream inStream);\n}\nBeam provides built-in Coders for various basic Java types (Integer, Long, Double, etc.).

Using Beam, you would need to explicitly set the coder every time you use a PTtransform.\nWhile it saves a lot of work, it also has a few drawbacks:\nKryo coders can be really inefficient. Especially if you forget to register your classes using a custom KryoRegistrar. The only way to be sure Kryo coders are correctly registered is to write tests and run them with a specific option: (see kryoRegistrationRequired=true). Kryo coders are very dynamic and it can be hard to know exactly which coder is used for a given class. Kryo coders do not always play well with Beam, and sometime can cause weird runtime exceptions.

It is for example used to serialize ADTs and Either Record: A Coder for record-like structures like case classes and tuples. Transform: A Coder implemented by “transforming” another Coder. Fallback: A default Coder. Used when there is no better option.\nThere is also a “special” coder called KVCoder. It is a specific coder for Key-Value pairs. Internally Beam treats KV differently from other types so Scio needs to do the same.\nIt is important to note that Scio’s coders are only representations of those cases but do not actually implement any serialization logic. Before the job starts, those coders will be materialized, meaning they will be converted to instances of `org.apache.beam.sdk.coders.Coder`.

However, SMB writes are more expensive than their regular counterparts, since they involve an extra group-by (bucketing) and sorting step. Additionally, non-SMB writes (i.e. implementations of FileBasedSink) use hints from the runner to determine an optimal number of output files. Unfortunately, SMB doesn’t have access to those runtime hints; you must specify the number of buckets and shards as static values up front.\nIn SMB, buckets correspond to the hashed value of the SMB key % a given power of 2. A record with a given key will always be hashed into the same bucket. On the file system, buckets consist of one or more sharded files in which records are randomly assigned per-bundle. Two records with the same key may end up in different shard files within a bucket.\nA good starting point is to look at your output data as it has been written by a non-SMB sink, and pick the closest power of 2 as your initial numBuckets and set numShards to 1.

For a given set of sources, targetParallelism can be set to any number between the least and greatest numbers of buckets among sources. This can be dynamically configured using TargetParallelism.min() or TargetParallelism.max(), which at graph construction time will determine the least or greatest amount of parallelism based on sources.\nAlternately, TargetParallelism.of(Integer value) can be used to statically configure a custom value, or {@link TargetParallelism#auto()} can be used to let the runner decide how to split the SMB read at runtime based on the combined byte size of the inputs–this is also the default behavior if TargetPallelism is left unspecified.\nIf no value is specified, SMB read operations will use Auto parallelism.\nWhen selecting a target parallelism for your SMB operation, there are tradeoffs to consider:\nMinimal parallelism means a fewer number of workers merging data from potentially many buckets. For example, if source A has 4 buckets and source B has 64, a minimally parallel SMB read would have 4 workers, each one merging 1 bucket from source A and 16 buckets from source B. This read may have low throughput. Maximal parallelism means that each bucket is read by at least one worker. For example, if source A has 4 buckets and source B has 64, a maximally parallel SMB read would have 64 workers, each one merging 1 bucket from source B and 1 bucket from source A, replicated 16 times. This may have better throughput than the minimal example, but more expensive because every key group from the replicated sources must be re-hashed to avoid emitting duplicate records. A custom parallelism in the middle of these bounds may be the best balance of speed and computing cost. Auto parallelism is more likely to pick an ideal value for most use cases. If its performance is worse than expected, you can look up the parallelism value it has computed and try a manual adjustment. Unfortunately, since it’s determined at runtime, the computed parallelism value can’t be added to the pipeline graph through DisplayData. Instead, you’ll have to check the worker logs to find out which value was selected. When using Dataflow, you can do this in the UI by clicking on the SMB transform box, and searching the associated logs for the text Parallelism was adjusted. For example, in this case the value is 1024: From there, you can try increasing or decreasing the parallelism by specifying a different TargetParallelism parameter to your SMB read. Often auto-parallelism will select a low value and using TargetParallelism.max() can help.","title":"Parallelism"},{"location":"/extras/Sort-Merge-Bucket.html#read-buffering","text":"Performance can suffer when reading an SMB source across many partitions if the total number of files (numBuckets * numShards * numPartitions) is too large (on the order of hundreds of thousands to millions of files).

To that end, we’ve added two PipelineOptions to Scio 0.10.3, settable either via command-line args or using SortedBucketOptions directly.\n--sortedBucketReadBufferSize (default: 10000): an Integer that determines the number of elements to read and buffer from each file at a time. For example, by default, each file will have 10,000 elements read and buffered into an in-memory array at worker startup. Then, the sort-merge algorithm will request them one at a time as needed. Once 10,000 elements have been requested, the file will buffer the next 10,000. Note: this can be quite memory-intensive and require bumping the worker memory. If you have a small number of files, or don’t need this optimization, you can turn it off by setting --sortedBucketReadBufferSize=0. --sortedBucketReadDiskBufferMb (default: unset): an Integer that, if set, will force each worker to actually copy the specified # of megabytes from the remote filesystem into the worker’s local temp directory, rather than streaming directly from FS.

The project was inspired by Spark and Scalding from the beginning, and we improved it over time working with customers of diverse background, including backend, data and ML. The design philosophy behind Scio can be summarized in a few points.\nMake it easy to do the right thing Scala made this possible for the most part. We have a fluent API and it’s easy to find the right transformation without going through lengthy documentation or source code. The most obvious thing is usually the best. .countByValue is clearer and more efficient than .map((_, 1L)).sumByKey than .map((_, 1L)).reduceByKey(_+_). Case classes and Options are much safer and easier than JSON-based TableRows with Objects and nulls, despite the effort we went through to make it work. One can .sum types with built-in Semigroups easily and correctly. Conversely there is no .groupAll since it could incur huge performance penalty and is essentially .groupBy(_ => ()). It’s easier to ask than making the wrong assumption and use it wrong (_“because it’s there”_). Make common use cases simple We have syntactic sugar for most common IO modules e.g. ScioContext#textFile, SCollection#saveAsBigQuery but don’t cover all possible parameters. There’s a trade-off between covering more use cases and keeping the API simple. We opted for a more flexible boilerplate free Args instead of the more type-safe PipelineOptions for command line arguments parsing. Mistakes in these parts of the code are easier to catch and less damaging than those in the computation logic. Another trade-off we made. We have syntactic sugars for various types of joins (hash, inner, outer, sketch) and side input operations (cross, lookup) that can be easily swapped to fine tune a pipeline. Make complex use cases possible We wrap complex internal APIs but don’t hide them away from users. Most low level Beam APIs (Pipeline, PCollection, PTransform) are still easily accessible. There are shorthands for integrating native Beam API, e.g. ScioContext#customInput, SCollection#saveAsCustomOutput, SCollection#applyTransform. Pipelines can be submitted from main, another process, a backend service, or chained with Futures.","title":"Design Philosophy"},{"location":"/scaladoc.html","text":"","title":""},{"location":"/Scio,-Scalding-and-Spark.html","text":"","title":"Scio, Spark and Scalding"},{"location":"/Scio,-Scalding-and-Spark.html#scio-spark-and-scalding","text":"Check out the Beam Programming Guide first for a detailed explanation of the Beam programming model and concepts.\nScio’s API is heavily influenced by Spark with a lot of ideas from Scalding.","title":"Scio, Spark and Scalding"},{"location":"/Scio,-Scalding-and-Spark.html#scio-and-spark","text":"The Dataflow programming model is fundamentally different from that of Spark. Read this Google blog article for more details.\nThe Scio API is heavily influenced by Spark but there are some minor differences.\n`SCollection` is equivalent to Spark’s RDD. `PairSCollectionFunctions` and `DoubleSCollectionFunctions` are specialized versions of SCollection and equivalent to Spark’s PairRDDFunctions and DoubleRDDFunctions. Execution planning is static and happens before the job is submitted. There is no driver node in a Dataflow cluster and one can only perform the equivalent of Spark transformations (RDD → RDD) but not actions (RDD → driver local memory). There is no broadcast either but the pattern of RDD → driver via action and driver → RDD via broadcast can be replaced with SCollection.asSingletonSideInput and SCollection.withSideInputs. There is no DStream (continuous series of RDDs) like in Spark Streaming. Values in an SCollection are windowed based on timestamp and windowing operation. The same API works regardless of batch (single global window by default) or streaming mode. Aggregation type transformations that produce SCollections of a single value under global window will produce one value each window when a non-global window is defined. SCollection has extra methods for side input, side output, and windowing.","title":"Scio and Spark"},{"location":"/Scio,-Scalding-and-Spark.html#scio-and-scalding","text":"Scio has a much simpler abstract data types compared to Scalding.\nScalding has many abstract data types like TypedPipe, Grouped, CoGrouped, SortedGrouped. Many of them are intermediate and enable some optimizations or wrap around Cascading’s data model. As a result many Scalding operations are lazily evaluated, for example in pipe.groupBy(keyFn).reduce(mergeFn), mergeFn is lifted into groupBy to operate on the map side as well. Scio on the other hand, has only one main data type SCollection[T] and SCollection[(K, V)] is a specialized variation when the elements are key-value pairs. All Scio operations are strictly evaluated, for example p.groupBy(keyFn) returns (K, Iterable[T]) where the values are immediately grouped, whereas p.reduceByKey(_ + _) groups (K, V) pairs on K and reduces values.\nSome features may look familiar to Scalding users.\n`Args` is a simple command line argument parser similar to the one in Scalding.
