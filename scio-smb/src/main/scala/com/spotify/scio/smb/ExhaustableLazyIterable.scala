/**
 * Single-use Iterable that wraps a lazy Iterator.
 *
 * Guarantees:
 *   - Can only be iterated once (fail-fast on second call)
 *   - Can be exhausted without iteration (for cleanup)
 *   - Clear error message guides users to materialize with .toSeq
 *
 * Usage:
 * {{{
 * val iterable = new ExhaustableLazyIterable(iterator)
 *
 * // Option 1: Single-pass consumption (lazy)
 * iterable.foldLeft(0)(_ + _)  // OK - consumes once
 *
 * // Option 2: Multiple passes (materialize first)
 * val seq = iterable.toSeq
 * val sum = seq.sum
 * val max = seq.max  // OK - Seq is re-iterable
 *
 * // Option 3: Never consumed (auto-exhausted by framework)
 * // iterable is passed to consumer but never used
 * // Framework calls exhaust() to ensure iterator advances
 * }}}
 *
 * @param underlying
 *   The lazy iterator to wrap
 * @tparam T
