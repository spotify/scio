/**
 * Represents the desired parallelism of an SMB read operation. For a given set of sources,
 * targetParallelism can be set to any number between the least and greatest numbers of buckets
 * among sources. This can be dynamically configured using {@link TargetParallelism#min()} or {@link
 * TargetParallelism#max()}, which at graph construction time will determine the least or greatest
 * amount of parallelism based on sources. Alternately, {@link TargetParallelism#of(int)} can be
 * used to statically configure a custom value.
 *
 * <p>If no value is specified, SMB read operations will use the minimum parallelism.
 *
 * <p>When selecting a target parallelism for your SMB operation, there are tradeoffs to consider:
 *
 * <p>- Minimal parallelism means a fewer number of workers merging data from potentially many
 * buckets. For example, if source A has 4 buckets and source B has 64, a minimally parallel SMB
 * read would have 4 workers, each one merging 1 bucket from source A and 16 buckets from source B.
 * This read may have low throughput. - Maximal parallelism means that each bucket is read by at
 * least one worker. For example, if source A has 4 buckets and source B has 64, a maximally
 * parallel SMB read would have 64 workers, each one merging 1 bucket from source B and 1 bucket
 * from source A, replicated 16 times. This may have better throughput than the minimal example, but
 * more expensive because every key group from the replicated sources must be re-hashed to avoid
 * emitting duplicate records. - A custom parallelism in the middle of these bounds may be the best
 * balance of speed and computing cost.
